# Basic-Python-Concepts-Practice


This repository contains two simple Python scripts that demonstrate basic user input, arithmetic operations, and string formatting.

---
## Assignment 1 Module 2 
### **Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations** (`Task_1.py`)

#### **Description**
This script takes **two numbers** as input from the user and performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (formatted to 2 decimal places)

#### **How It Works**
1. Prompts the user to enter two integer values.
2. Performs basic arithmetic operations.
3. Displays the results in a clear format.

#### **Sample Output**
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.00
```

### **Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting** (`Task_2.py`)

#### **Description**
This script takes the **first name** and **last name** as input and prints a personalized greeting message.

#### **How It Works**
1. Prompts the user to enter their first and last name.
2. Displays a welcome message with the provided name.

#### **Sample Output**
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```


## Assignment 2: Module 3 - Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of **control structures** in Python, including conditional statements and loops.

## **Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd** (`Task_1.py`)

### **Description**
This program:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is **even** or **odd** using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### **How It Works**
- The program uses the modulus operator `%` to determine if a number is divisible by 2.
- If `number % 2 == 0`, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

### **Sample Output**
```
Enter a Number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```

Another Example:
```
Enter a number: 10
10 is an even number.
```

## **Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop** (`Task_2.py`)

### **Description**
This program:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from **1 to 50**.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### **How It Works**
- Initializes a variable `sum = 0`.
- Loops through numbers from 1 to 50 and adds each number to `sum`.
- Prints the total sum after the loop ends.

### **Sample Output**
```
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
